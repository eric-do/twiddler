# Twiddler

Twiddler is a Twitter clone. This project was done as part of Hack Reactor's Precourse.

## Feature notes
* All processing is done on one page - index.html
* All Jquery scripts are contained in lib/scripts.js
* Human readable datetime formatting was done using moment.js

## Things learned during development
### Using Jquery on dynamically created content
There was a problem where the usernames were no longer clickable after loading in new tweets. It turns out not all Jquery functions work on dynamically generated content.
* .click() and .on() don't work on dynamically generated content
* For dynamic content, it's best to use .on(), but it needs to be called on a static parent element, passing the dynamically generated child element as a parameter, e.g.
```javascript
$('.tweet-container').on('click', '.user-link', function() {
      var username = this.text.substring(1);
      var tweetArray = streams.home.filter(function(tweet){
        return tweet.user === username;
      });
      outputTweets(tweetArray);
    });
```
In the example above, .tweet-container is static, but new .user-link are created whenever we load more tweets.

### Scrollbar shifting
The content of the page would constantly shift to left once a scrollbar appeared. The solution to this was to have the vertical scrollbar always displayed.
```
html {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```
### Aligning elements and text
It was difficult to get elements horizontally/vertically centered.
